Make conversion return floats
Make it assume inputs correct for HCL (they can be out)
Investigate S instead of C (% of max chroma possible for that luma)
 - This may mess up nice calcs?
 -- Maybe multiply chroma by luma if luma < 0.5
 --- and chroma by (1-luma) if luma > 0.5 
 --- then do hprime calc
Improve the "test suite"
Add float to int calculator
