* Make it assume inputs correct for HCL (they can be out)

* Investigate S instead of C (% of max chroma possible for that luma)
- Use sector to calculate luminance of 100% chroma
- Use this value to then calculate % luma, which is max chroma at this luma
- The calculate required chroma from saturation at this luma

* Split calculations into smaller functions.

* Add float to int calculator
